# Information About Mini Drones
*Based on product ID 9 "Mini Drone" from our product database*

## General Information
Mini drones, also known as Miniature UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) or Small UAVs (SUAVs), are aerial vehicles small enough to be man-portable. They range from micro air vehicles (MAVs) that can be carried by infantry to larger models that can be transported and launched like infantry man-portable air-defense systems.

## Classification and Regulations
Different countries have various definitions for small UAVs based on weight:
- Canada: Less than 2 kg
- United States: Less than 25 kg
- European Union (SESAR): Less than 25 kg
- United Kingdom (CAA): Less than 20 kg

## Types and Examples

### Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs)
The smallest class of mini drones, sometimes as small as 5 centimeters. Notable examples include:

- **DelFly Micro**: Developed by TU Delft University in the Netherlands in 2008
  - Size: 10 centimeters
  - Weight: 3 grams
  - Features: Camera-equipped ornithopter (flapping wing aircraft)
  - Limitations: Battery weight (1 gram) constitutes a third of total weight

- **Harvard University MAV**: 
  - Size: Just 3 centimeters
  - Limitation: Power supplied through a wire (not autonomous)
  - Achievements: Controlled hovering flight (2013), landings and takeoffs from different surfaces (2016)

### Military and Commercial Mini Drones

  - Users: US SOCOM, US Army, US Marines, and several other countries
  - Applications: Combat operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other locations

- **Bayraktar Mini UAV**:
  - Origin: Turkey
  - Type: Hand-launched, portable UAV system
  - Design: For harsh geographic and meteorological conditions

- **Aeryon Scout**:
  - Type: Man-packable quadcopter
  - Weight: 1.3 kg
  - Features: Onboard intelligence, all-digital communications, map-based touch-screen control
  - Endurance: Approximately 20 minutes
  - Wind resistance: Up to 50 km/h
  - Payload: Approximately 250 grams

- **T-Hawk MAV**:
  - Developer: Honeywell (United States)
  - Type: Ducted fan VTOL (Vertical Take-Off and Landing)
  - Users: US Army and US Navy Explosive Ordnance Division
  - Applications: Searching for roadside bombs, target inspection
  - Notable use: Deployed at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami

## Practical Applications
Mini drones serve various purposes in different sectors:

### Military and Security
- Intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR)
- Short-range reconnaissance missions
- Search for explosive devices
- Urban security and crime-fighting

### Civilian and Commercial
- Aerial photography
- Traffic observation
- Search and rescue operations (e.g., earthquake victims)
- Exploration of hazardous environments (e.g., radioactivity-contaminated buildings)
- Research and academic purposes

### Challenges and Future Development
- Battery weight and energy consumption limitations
- Sensor integration (gyroscopes, wind sensors, cameras)
- Autonomous flight capabilities
- Size reduction while maintaining functionality
- Weather resistance and operational conditions

Mini drones continue to evolve rapidly with advances in battery technology, materials science, and miniaturized electronics, making them increasingly versatile tools for both military and civilian applications.
